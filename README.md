# Objective

The purpose of this task is to practice retrieving data from a database (Student Data) using SELECT queries. This includes filtering rows, projecting specific columns, sorting results, limiting output, and using operators like WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, and BETWEEN.

## Tools Used

MySQL Workbench (or any SQL environment)

## Deliverables

Sql_Task3.sql â†’ contains SQL queries for:

Selecting all student records and specific columns

Filtering student rows with WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN

Sorting results with ORDER BY (ascending & descending)

Limiting output rows with LIMIT

Using DISTINCT and column aliasing

## Key Concepts Practiced

SELECT * vs selecting specific student columns

Using WHERE with conditions

Applying AND, OR for multiple conditions

Pattern matching with LIKE '%value%' for names

Range filtering using BETWEEN for mark or age

Sorting student data using ORDER BY ASC/DESC

Limiting student rows using LIMIT

Removing duplicates departments with DISTINCT

Column aliasing with AS

## Outcome

Gained hands-on experience in extracting and filtering student data from a relational database.

Learned to apply different SQL clauses to retrieve meaningful academic insights.
